# Task 1 — Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

## Task Name
Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

## Objective
The objective of this task is to load, inspect, and visualize the Iris dataset to understand feature relationships, data distributions, and possible outliers using Python data analysis libraries.

## Dataset
Iris Dataset (loaded using seaborn)

## Tools and Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Description
In this project, the dataset was explored using basic data inspection methods such as `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`. Visualizations including scatter plots, histograms, and box plots were created to analyze patterns and distributions within the data.
